# Ollama Model Tool Support Analysis Report
Test Date: 2025-05-06 21:47:47

## Summary
- Total models tested: 18
- Native tool support successes: 4 (22.2%)
- **Verified** tool support (passed obscure fact test): 4 (22.2%)
- Alternative method successes: 13
- Interface method successes: 13

### Verification Methodology
Models were tested with both common queries (Tokyo population) and obscure facts (Vaduz, Liechtenstein population) 
to distinguish between genuine tool use and knowledge recall through inference. 
A model passes verification when it successfully retrieves and incorporates information about an obscure topic 
that would be unlikely to appear in its training data.
